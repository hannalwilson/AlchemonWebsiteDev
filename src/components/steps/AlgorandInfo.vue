        <i>Alchemon</i> is a combination of the words “<u>Al</u>gorand” + “Al<u>ch</u>emy” + “<u>Mon</u>ster.”

        Algorand is one of the most-used blockchains in the world and its cryptocurrency (ALGO) is growing in popularity every
        day! Algorand was chosen as the blockchain to build Alchemon on because:
        <ol>
            <li>Algorand has relatively low transaction fees compared to other blockchains (it costs less than a cent to send things on
            the Algorand blockchain).<br><br></li>
            <li>Algorand is a green blockchain – meaning, it’s carbon-negative (Algorand actually removes carbon dioxide from the
            atmosphere rather than adding it).<br><br></li>
            <li>Algorand is one of the most secure blockchains. Keeping our users safe is one of our top priorities!</li>
