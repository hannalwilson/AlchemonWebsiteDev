                <u>WHATS NEW</u>
            </p>
            <p class="justifiedText">
                - Leveling system: boost your Alchemon's power by leveling them up! Knock out enemies and win battles to
                gain experience. Level caps set temporarily until V1 release.
                <br>- Evolutions: Coming in 1.0 release.
                <br>- Equipable NFTs: Purchase alchebility NFTs from our Website and equip them to your Alchemon!
                Each
                attack can be equipped to a single Alchemon of the same type (fire, water, psychic, etc).
                <br>- Set 5 Alchemon: All set 5 cards are now implemented in game!
                <br>- First community set: All Alchemon/Yieldy Flamingos have been added to the game! Once the set has
                been
                released to the public, they will become playable.
                <br>- Improved rewards - Each win now rewards players with 6 ALCH. On top of this, each win will count
                as a
                single entry into the Hunting Grounds rewards lottery.
                <br>- Forgot Password Functionality added.

                <br>- Balanced Alchemon animation's scale.
                <br>- Fixed bug that prevented battle from ending when final Alchemon was affected with the Singed

            <p class="grayHeader spreadText">JUNE 2022 UPDATE</p>
            <p class="whiteText">Hello Alcheholics,
                <br><br>
            </p>
            <p class="justifiedText whiteText">We have news & an updated roadmap for you. Due to the exploit we have had
                to
                increase security. Many of
                these have already been developed in response, but the only real solution is to migrate the game logic
                to a server, which we have been working on and making good progress. Until this is out in V1 we will
                continue to airdrop ALCH for wins. This migration was always on our radar, but we did not expect to have
                to do it until Q3 for PVP. It became abundantly clear that to allow people to cash out we will have to
                have this implemented.
                Another very important milestone for V1 has been to make V1 the last game download needed, so we can
                easily make patches & updates. This has taken a lot more time than expected, but it is a vital step to
                be considered a full game launch.
                <br><br>
                Mainly due to these two factors it has become clear we will not make the Q2 deadline for V1. So instead
                of pushing the whole release we have decided to release a Beta 2.0 which will have some of the new
                features of V1. This will allow users to play with their Set 5 cards sooner & also will have the 1st
                Community Set in it as well! It will also come with a new AlcheCoin rewards buff & implement the new
                Hunting Grounds rewards. Also, “ASA Attacks” have been rebranded to Alchebilities & will be included as
                well.
                <br><br>
                While we aren’t excited to share this news, we do want to let people know development is going well,
                there are considerable additions to the roadmap, & we are committed to keep building the right way. We
                have a ton of cool ideas & plans not included here.
                <br><br>
                Clifford (CEO), Hanna (CTO) & Forest (Lead Dev) will be doing an AMA with Algo Gaming Guild on Weds June
                15th at 3PM PST.

            <p class="whiteText">I take pride in having the worst, least-detailed roadmaps in crypto, but here we are.
                The team & I
                pounded this out for you all so you know what we are focused on going into the future. The team is up to
                10 members!
                <br><br>
                Obviously these are target dates & rely on many moving parts so they are not set in stone, but we did
                our best to be conservative in our estimates. This is for major milestones & doesn't include a lot of
                surprises we have up our sleeves, other improvements we intend to make on Training/Hunting Grounds or
                Alchemon releases past Set 5. We assume we will work into some sort of regular Alchemon release cadence
                once V1 of the game is out.
