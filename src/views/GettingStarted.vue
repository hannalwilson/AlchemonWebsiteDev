            4 Rare, 2 Epic, and 1 Legendary. Lower level cards (Common and Uncommon) can
            evolve to higher levels through staking in the Training Grounds, leveling up in game, or by trading in
            lower rarity cards and a small evolving fee at our <router-link to="/craftandevolve">Craft & Evolve
            </router-link>
            store. Epic and Legendary Alchemon can be crafted here, as well, by trading in the correct lower rarity
            cards
            with a small evolving fee.<br><br>
            You can purchase Common Alchemon in our official <router-link to="/store">Alcheshop</router-link> or higher

        <p class="grayHeader spreadText">STAKING</p>
        <p class="whiteText">Stake your Common or Uncommon Alchemon for 6 days in the Training Grounds Wallet and
            they will evolve to the next level. Supplies in the Staking Wallet are limited, so it will be first
            come, first serve. Your Alchemon that you sent will get evolved, so you will not receive it back, but
            will receive a more powerful version! Make sure you add the asset of the Alchemon you will be receiving.
            Add Alchemon Assets via the AlcheDex page. There are links to add a single asset or multiple assets via
            smart contract. Also, typing in the Alchemon into the official wallet and approving the asset works.
            Click <router-link to="/traininggrounds">here</router-link> to view how many Alchemon are
            available
            for staking rewards.</p>

        <p class="orangeHeader spreadText">TRADING</p>
        <p>If you canâ€™t wait to stake then it will take some alchemy to get the job done. Trade 2 copies of the SAME
            Common or Uncommon Alchemon at our Craft & Evolve Store and in return you will receive an evolved
            version! <br><br>This is all set up smart contracts and is completely trustless, so a
            small fee to Trade is involved. These are also a limited supply, so trade while they are available!</p>

    <div class="crafting">
        <p class="orangeHeader spreadText">CRAFTING</p>
        <p>The first and second Rares of each set combine to make an Epic level Alchemon. The third and fourth
            combine to make another Epic level Alchemon. Combine both unique Epics to craft the rumored Legendary
            Alchemon. Remember you are combining these 2 Alchemon to make a stronger one, so the original 2 get sent
            back to the Trading & Staking Wallets. Getting to the top will not be easy. This is also done through
            smart contracts and will have a higher fee than Trading.</p>
