            <br><br>There are two ways to evolve your Alchemon: Trading or Staking.

        <p class="whiteText">Stake your Common or Uncommon Alchemon for 6 days in the Training Grounds Wallet and
            they will evolve to the next level. Supplies in the Staking Wallet are limited, so it will be first
            come, first serve. Your Alchemon that you sent will get evolved, so you will not receive it back, but
            will receive a more powerful version! Make sure you add the asset of the Alchemon you will be receiving.
            Add Alchemon Assets via the AlcheDex page. There are links to add a single asset or multiple assets via
            smart contract. Also, typing in the Alchemon into the official wallet and approving the asset works.

            available
            for staking rewards.</p>

        <p>If you canâ€™t wait to stake then it will take some alchemy to get the job done. Trade 2 copies of the SAME
            Common or Uncommon Alchemon at our Craft & Evolve Store and in return you will receive an evolved
            version! <br><br>This is all set up smart contracts and is completely trustless, so a
            small fee to Trade is involved. These are also a limited supply, so trade while they are available!</p>

        <p>The first and second Rares of each set combine to make an Epic level Alchemon. The third and fourth
            combine to make another Epic level Alchemon. Combine both unique Epics to craft the rumored Legendary
            Alchemon. Remember you are combining these 2 Alchemon to make a stronger one, so the original 2 get sent
            back to the Trading & Staking Wallets. Getting to the top will not be easy. This is also done through
            smart contracts and will have a higher fee than Trading.</p>
