    <p>
        Cryptocurrency is digital money.
        <br><br>
        “Crypto” means “secret” or “hidden.”
        <br><br>
        Cryptocurrency allows individuals to stay anonymous (not reveal their identity) and it operates independently of a
        central bank. Users can store their cryptocurrency online and use it to make purchases.
        <br><br>
        The most popular form of cryptocurrency is bitcoin. It is a combination of the word “bit” (binary digit – the 1s and 0s
        that computers utilize to operate) and “coin.”
        <br><br>
        A secure record of all bitcoin transactions is stored online. New bitcoin is released slowly over time. In a little over
        100 years from now, there will be no further bitcoin released. Bitcoin has a cash value that fluctuates often. You can
        sell your bitcoin for cash or other cryptocurrency. You can purchase things with it as well.
    </p>
    <h3>BLOCKCHAIN</h3>
    <p>
        Cryptocurrency utilizes the blockchain. Blockchain is a record of all cryptocurrency transactions that is maintained
        across a network of several computers.
        <br><br>
        A “block” is a record of a new transaction, and when a block occurs, it is added to the “chain” (items linked together).
        <br><br>
        Blockchain allows cryptocurrency to be distributed but not copied – meaning, each individual piece of data can only have
        one owner at a time.
        <br><br>
        A popular website about blockchain called “Blockgeeks.com” gives a good example of blockchain: <i>“Picture a spreadsheet
        that is duplicated thousands of times across a network of computers. Then imagine that this network is designed to
        regularly update this spreadsheet and you have a basic understanding of the blockchain.”</i>
        <br><br>
        Verifying cryptocurrency transactions is referred to as “mining.” It is called this due to its similarities in mining
        valuable minerals (like gold) – it takes hard work and persistence. Every time a bitcoin transaction occurs, a “miner”
        (one engaging in mining) is responsible for verifying the authenticity (accuracy and honesty) of the transaction. The
        mining is accomplished with specific hardware and automated software. “Miners” are rewarded with occasional
        cryptocurrency in exchange for their work.
        <br><br>
        Satoshi Nakamoto is the fictitious name of the unknown person or group that invented bitcoin. Their true identity is
        hidden. They released bitcoin (the first cryptocurrency) in 2009 and there are now over 1,000 other types of
        cryptocurrencies.
        <br><br>
        As an interesting note on digital money, not just cryptocurrency: only about 10% of the world’s currency is physical
        money, the rest only exists on computers.
    </p>
    <h3>NFTs</h3>
    <p>
        <i>NFT</i> stands for <i>Non-Fungible Token</i>.
        <br><br>
        To start, let’s define <i>token</i>. A token is something that can be traded on a blockchain. For example, a single bitcoin or
        a portion of bitcoin are both tokens.
        <br><br>
        <i>Fungible</i> refers to goods or commodities (like physical money) that can be traded or exchanged one for another. It refers
        to something that can be freely exchanged or replaced, in whole or in part, for another of like nature or kind.
        <i>Fungibility</i> refers to two things that are identical in specification, where individual units can be mutually
        substituted. For example, two dollar bills are fungible.
        <br><br>
        <i>Non-fungible</i> means “not able to be exchanged or mixed with other similar goods or assets.”
        <br><br>
        An NFT is a token that is totally unique and cannot be substituted with another token. Each NFT has a non-transferable
        identity that distinguishes it from other tokens.
        <br><br>
        A common type of NFT is digital art. Users can purchase an image and thereby own that digital image. What makes it an
        NFT is that other people cannot alter the image or own the image.
        <br><br>
        More recently, some digital art pieces have been divided into portions. For example, a picture of a waterfall divided
        into 100 pieces, each one a separate NFT – thereby evenly splitting the ownership across 100 individuals.
        <br><br>
        Other examples of NFTs are music, graphics and videos.
    </p>
    <h3>SUMMARY</h3>
    <p>
        The huge network that is the internet has made the development of a new form of currency possible. This is called
        “cryptocurrency.” Basically, it is money, tracked entirely online using computers and software. The technology behind it
        involves keeping a continuous record of every piece of this digital currency, and what has happened to it, on multiple
        computers simultaneously. That way the accuracy of the currency and its history can be verified at any time, so people
        can trust its use. It also allows people to remain anonymous.<br><br>
